The experiments where pretty straight forward as i followed and did the same as the tutorials told me to. Only issues I really had was some of the commands to run the program didnt quite work as i had to move back and forth with the working directory. 
Other than that no issues.

I felt it was natural to create a new github repository for the code as it is a completely different type of project than the prevoius assignments as the repository would get messy. I did have some issues with github as well bit managed to solve it.
